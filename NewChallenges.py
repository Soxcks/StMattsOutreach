#Beginner Challenges

#Challenge 1:
#Make a slash from 0-0 to 7-7 using calls to set_pixel()

#Challenge 2:
#Do the same, but using a FOR loop to use only one set_pixel() line

#Challenge 3:
#Switch the slash from Challenge 2 to go from 0-7 to 7-0

#Challenge 4:
#Light one column using a FOR loop

#Challenge 5:
#Light one row using a FOR loop

#Intermediate Challenges
#Challenge 6:
#Make an oscillating dot, like Knight Rider, or a Cylon

#Challenge 7:
#Make an oscillating column in a non-primary colour

#Challenge 8:
#Make a fire truck light (light up one column at a time until all columns are on, then turn them off one column at a time)

#Challenge 9:
#Make a police light, strobe between half blue half red, then the opposite

#Challenge 10:
#Light columns (or rows) 0,2,4 and 6 using only two FOR loops, using a range operator in the outer looop

#Expert Challenges
#Challenge 11:
#In the examples folder, ascii_pic.py uses an arrany to set pixels on or off checking whether the array cell is blank or not.  Copy
#ascii_pic.py and change it so that you can set a pixels colour using 'R' 'G' 'B' in the array

#Challenge 12:
#Take a colour as input from the user.  This could be either menu-based ("1 for Red, 2 for Blue) or text based ("Enter a colour:") Make sure you include an Exit option for either method.  Use the set_all() function to set the entire array their colour choice

#Challenge 13:
#Make a rainbow in columns.  You can use set_pixel_hsv() to use Hue, which goes from 0.0 to 1.0.  Just divide 1 by the number of steps to make a full rainbow.

#Challenge 14:
#Use recursion to create a reducing square rainbow

#Challenge 15:
#Make the colours scroll in Challenge 14
